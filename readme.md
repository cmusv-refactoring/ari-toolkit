# **Mockito Migration Task**

You will work with the case study ari-toolkit (original [readme.md](original-readme.md)) that currently uses an outdated version of the Mockito
library (1.10.19). Your goal is to upgrade the case study to rely on Mockito's new version (2.1), ensuring the system 
is compatible with the newer API.
